          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            A rival school released a whiskey under their name. Garrett Steck
            was intrigued by the idea and thought, why not Wofford College?
            <br /><br />
            A few months later with the help of Master Blender Dixon Dedman,
            Steck launched 1854 Reserve, a private label bourbon, as a tribute
            to his alma mater, Wofford College. 1854 Reserve was a resounding
            success among Wofford alumni – all bottles for sale online
            completely sold out within a week and a half.
            <br /><br />
            Steck decided to offer the excitement and engagement of private
            label bourbon to additional passionate community groups through
            Southern Specialty Spirits.
