            <h2>1854 Reserve</h2>
            <p>1854 Reserve was created to pay tribute to Wofford College, an icon of southern higher education, and the many lives that it has shaped since its founding in 1854. Developed with the expertise of Wofford alum and master blender Dixon Dedman, 1854 Reserve is a 6-year-old wheated Kentucky straight bourbon. </p>

            <h2>Flavor Profile of the Old Main Edition</h2>
            <p>This is a highly drinkable bourbon that will please both the aficionados and those new to the drink. A smooth 96 proof, the nose brings hints of cinnamon and fresh wood shavings, while the palate evokes cherry compote.</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>1854 Reserve is the result of true Wofford alumni collaboration: the founder, master blender, investor, lawyer, graphic designer, label designer, distributor, and retail stores all have ties to Wofford College. The bottle design features elements unique to Wofford College, such as the late 1800s rendering of the original campus on the label and the college’s initials on the wax seal found in the school archives. Founder Garrett Steck hand numbered each bottle, giving each a personal touch.
              <br><br>
              In addition to creating an opportunity to reconnect with Wofford College, 1854 Reserve gives back by donating a portion of sales proceeds to the school, connecting alumni with future generations of Wofford students.

                  “@1854reserve gets it right. The initial nose is spot on with tempting aromas of toffee, vanilla, and apricot – no foul esters gumming up the works. The palate subtly supplements those flavors with cherry and saddle leather.
            
                  <br><br>
            
                  1854 Reserve comes in at 96 proof but drinks lower (I had guessed 90 in my sample tasting). This was one smooooth bourbon.”

                  “Drinks very well for the 6-year age statement. You’re not getting those grain-forward, young whiskey notes. But you also aren’t getting low viscosity, high tannin like you can with some older whiskey. I enjoy the sweetness of Wheated bourbon, and this delivers that sweetness on par with some of my favorite sub-100 proof wheaters, such as Maker’s Mark and Larceny Small Batch, while holding its own uniqueness.

                  Where this bourbon outshines is in the depth of flavor profile (that baked cookie note), mouthfeel (more mouth coating), proof point, and finish. A very refined Wheated bourbon, and excellent first outing for 1854 Reserve.”
